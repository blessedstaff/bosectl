# BMAP Library Architecture

This guide covers the shared architecture of the BMAP protocol libraries
(Python, Rust, C++). All three implement the same layered design and
feature-dispatch model. Language-specific details are in
[Language Implementations](#language-implementations) at the end.

## Overview

The BMAP library controls Bose Bluetooth headphones over RFCOMM without
the Bose app, cloud accounts, or authentication. It works by speaking the
BMAP (Bose Media Application Protocol) binary protocol directly over a
Bluetooth serial connection.

```

## Layers

### Protocol Codec

The lowest layer. Encodes and decodes raw BMAP packets on the wire.

**Packet format:**
```
Byte 0:    fblock     — function block ID (e.g. 1=Settings, 2=Status, 31=AudioModes)
Byte 1:    func       — function ID within the block
Byte 2:    flags      — operator in low nibble (& 0x0F), upper bits carry
                         device_id and port_num (typically zero)
Byte 3:    length     — payload length in bytes
Byte 4+:   payload    — operation-specific data
```

**Functions:**
- `bmap_packet(fblock, func, operator, payload)` — encode a request
- `parse_response(data)` — decode a single response frame
- `parse_all_responses(data)` — split concatenated frames (used after drain)
- `encode_mode_name(name)` — UTF-8 to 32-byte null-padded buffer

**Operators:**

| Code | Name     | Direction     | Description |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| 0    | SET      | Request       | Write (requires cloud auth) |
| 1    | GET      | Request       | Read a value |
| 2    | SETGET   | Request       | Write + read back (no auth on most blocks) |
| 3    | STATUS   | Response      | Data response / unsolicited notification |
| 4    | ERROR    | Response      | Error with code in payload[0] |
| 5    | START    | Request       | Trigger an action |
| 6    | RESULT   | Response      | Action completed |
| 7    | PROCESSING | Response    | Async operation in progress |

### Transport

Manages the Bluetooth RFCOMM socket connection.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Connection
    participant T as Transport
    participant D as Device

    C->>T: send_recv(packet)
    T->>D: socket.send(packet)
    T->>T: sleep(200ms)
    D->>T: socket.recv(response)
    T->>C: return response

    Note over C,D: Drain mode (for multi-response commands)

    C->>T: send_recv_drain(packet)
    T->>D: socket.send(packet)
    T->>T: sleep(200ms)
    D->>T: recv[0] (3s timeout)
    loop Until timeout
        T->>T: set 500ms timeout
        D-->>T: recv[n] (may timeout)
    end
    T->>C: return concatenated data
```

**Key behaviors:**
- **Normal mode**: Send packet, wait up to 3 seconds for one response
- **Drain mode**: Send packet, collect all responses until 500ms silence — used for commands that return multiple STATUS frames (e.g. `GetAll`)
- **200ms post-send delay**: Required by the BMAP protocol between send and first recv

The drain interface differs slightly by language: Python uses a boolean
parameter (`send_recv(packet, drain=True)`), while Rust and C++ have a
separate method (`send_recv_drain(packet)`).

**Platform support:**

| Platform | Python | Rust | C++ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux | BlueZ `AF_BLUETOOTH` socket | BlueZ socket | BlueZ socket |
| macOS | IOBluetooth RFCOMM via PyObjC | compiles; connect returns an error pointing at the Python CLI | same as Rust |

`RfcommTransport` in Python is bound at import time to either
`LinuxRfcommTransport` or `MacOsRfcommTransport` on `sys.platform`; callers
see one class. Discovery follows the same split (`bluetoothctl` on Linux,
`IOBluetoothDevice.pairedDevices()` on macOS).

### Device Config

A data-only description of a specific headphone model. No logic — just addresses,
parser/builder function references, and capability flags.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DeviceConfig
        INFO[Device Info<br/>name, codename, platform]
        CHAN[RFCOMM Channel<br/>2 or 8]
        INIT[Init Packet<br/>optional]
        FEAT[Feature Map<br/>name → addr + parser + builder]
        MODES[Preset Modes<br/>name → index]
        SLOTS[Editable Slots<br/>profile indices]
        CELLS[Battery Metadata<br/>component ID → label<br/>aggregate component ID]
    end
```

Each feature entry maps a name to its protocol address and codec functions:

```
"anr" → {
    addr:    (1, 6)          — fblock 1, function 6
    parser:  parse_anr       — bytes → "high"/"low"/"wind"/"off"
    builder: build_anr       — "high" → bytes([0x01])
}
```

**Device quirks are expressed as config differences, not code branches:**

Multi-component battery devices declare display labels and an aggregate
component ID in config. For `edith`, IDs 1/2/3 are Right/Left/Case and ID 4
is the combined earbud level. If ID 4 is absent or reports 0xFF, the lowest
valid reading from the configured aggregate sources (the buds, IDs 1/2) is
used instead. Unknown IDs are preserved in the snapshot but only configured
components are rendered.

| Property | QC Ultra 2 | QuietComfort Headphones (`prince`) | QC35 |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|------|
| RFCOMM channel | 2 | 8 | 8 |
| Init packet | None | None | GET [0.1] required |
| Noise control | CNC [1.5] / live [31.10] | CNC/wind via [31.6] ModeConfig | ANR [1.6] (off/high/wind/low) |
| EQ | 3-band [1.7] | 3-band [1.7] | Not supported |
| Spatial audio | [31.6] ModeConfig | Field observed in [31.6] | Not supported |
| Mode profiles | 7 editable slots (4-10) | 2 editable slots observed (2-3) | None |
| Sidetone | [1.11] | Not verified | [1.11] |
| Multipoint | [1.10] | Not verified | Not supported |
| Button remap | Shortcut (0x80) | Not verified | Action (0x10) |

### BmapConnection

The primary public API. Composes a transport with a device config to provide
typed read/write methods. All feature methods use the same dispatch pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Conn as BmapConnection
    participant Cfg as DeviceConfig
    participant T as Transport
    participant P as Protocol

    App->>Conn: set_anr("high")
    Conn->>Cfg: lookup feature "anr"
    Cfg-->>Conn: addr=(1,6), builder=build_anr
    Conn->>Conn: payload = build_anr("high") → [0x01]
    Conn->>P: bmap_packet(1, 6, SETGET, [0x01])
    P-->>Conn: raw bytes [01 06 02 01 01]
    Conn->>T: send_recv(raw bytes)
    T-->>Conn: response bytes
    Conn->>P: parse_response(response)
    P-->>Conn: BmapResponse{op=STATUS, payload=[0x01, 0x0b]}
    Conn->>Conn: check for ERROR
    Conn-->>App: ok
```

**Read pattern** (GET):
```
battery_status()  →  one GET  →  aggregate level + component ID/level pairs
battery() / status()  →  reuse the parsed battery status
```

`BatteryStatus` keeps the aggregate and all component readings from that one
response. `DeviceStatus.battery_readings` carries the same snapshot to CLIs,
which render known components in config order rather than packet order.

**Write pattern** (SETGET):
```
set_anr("high")  →  lookup addr + builder  →  build payload  →  send SETGET  →  check for errors
```

**Action pattern** (START + drain):
```
modes()  →  _start_drain("get_all_modes")  →  send START  →  drain all STATUS  →  parse each  →  collect
```

### Parsers & Builders

Pure functions that convert between wire bytes and typed values.
Shared across device configs — a parser is referenced by name in the
feature map, not inherited.

**Parsers** decode response payloads:
```
parse_battery([0x50, 0xff, 0xff, 0x00])  →  80
parse_battery_readings([0x3c,0xff,0xff,0x01, ...])  →  [(component=1, level=60), ...]
parse_cnc([0x0b, 0x07, 0x03])            →  (current=7, max=10)
parse_anr([0x01, 0x0b])                  →  "high"
parse_buttons([0x10, 0x04, 0x01, 0x07])  →  ButtonMapping{Action, single_press, VPA}
```

**Builders** encode request payloads:
```
build_anr("high")                         →  bytes([0x01])
build_sidetone(2)                         →  bytes([0x01, 0x02])
build_buttons(0x10, 4, 2)                 →  bytes([0x10, 0x04, 0x02])
build_mode_config_40(5, "Custom", cnc_level=8)  →  40-byte payload
build_mode_config_39(3, "Music", cnc_level=5)   →  39-byte payload
```

Builders accept both integer IDs and string names where applicable
(e.g. `build_buttons("Action", "single_press", "ANC")`).

## Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Application
    participant Lib as connect()
    participant Disc as Discovery
    participant T as Transport
    participant D as Device

    App->>Lib: connect(mac=None)
    Lib->>Disc: find_bmap_device()
    Disc->>Disc: bluetoothctl devices Paired
    Disc->>Disc: Filter by BMAP UUID + audio class
    Disc->>Disc: Extract product ID from Modalias
    Disc-->>Lib: (mac="4C:87:...", type="qc35")
    Lib->>Lib: get_device("qc35") → config
    Lib->>T: RfcommTransport(mac, channel=8)
    T->>D: RFCOMM connect
    D-->>T: connected

    Note over Lib,D: QC35 quirk: init packet required

    Lib->>T: send_recv(GET [0.1])
    D-->>T: STATUS response
    Lib-->>App: BmapConnection(transport, config)
```

**Discovery** uses `bluetoothctl` to enumerate paired devices, filtering by:
1. Device class contains `audio-headset` or `audio-headphones`
2. SDP records contain BMAP UUID `00000000-deca-fade-deca-deafdecacaff`
3. Modalias product ID maps to a known device type

Connected devices are preferred over paired-but-disconnected.
When a caller supplies a MAC explicitly, it must also supply the device config
key; the type can only be detected while discovering the MAC.

## Error Handling

BMAP errors are returned in ERROR (op 4) responses with an error code
in `payload[0]`:

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Length | Payload size wrong |
| 3 | FblockNotSupp | Function block doesn't exist |
| 4 | FuncNotSupp | Function doesn't exist in block |
| 5 | OpNotSupp | Requires cloud-mediated ECDH auth |
| 6 | InvalidData | Value out of range or wrong format |
| 8 | Runtime | Firmware-level rejection (e.g. preset mode locked) |
| 10 | InvalidState | Pre-requisite not met |
| 15 | InvalidTransition | State machine violation |
| 20 | InsecureTransport | Encrypted link required |

The library surfaces these at appropriate levels:
- **Unsupported feature** → raised immediately at lookup time (not sent to device)
- **Auth error (code 5)** → distinct error type for programmatic handling
- **Device errors** → include the error code and formatted response

## Authentication Model

BMAP has two write paths with different auth requirements:

```mermaid
graph TD
    GET[GET op=1] -->|Always free| READ[Read any value]
    SETGET[SETGET op=2] -->|Free on blocks 1, 31| WRITE[Write + confirm]
    SET[SET op=0] -->|Cloud auth required| LOCKED[Rejected without ECDH]
    START[START op=5] -->|Free on block 31| ACTION[Trigger action]

    style GET fill:#26de81,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style SETGET fill:#26de81,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style START fill:#26de81,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style SET fill:#fc5c65,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style READ fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333
    style WRITE fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333
    style LOCKED fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333
    style ACTION fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#333
```

The library uses SETGET (not SET) for all writes and START for mode
switching. This gives full control over settings, profiles, and modes
without any authentication.

## Device Catalog

The catalog module (`catalog.py` / `catalog.rs` / `catalog.h`) is the
single source of truth for all known Bose BMAP devices. It's sourced from
Bose's firmware manifest at `downloads.bose.com/lookup.xml`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    CAT[Device Catalog<br/>known BMAP devices] --> SUP[Supported<br/>config ≠ None]
    CAT --> UNSUP[Recognized but Unsupported<br/>config = None]
    SUP --> DISC[Discovery<br/>PID → config lookup]
    SUP --> CFG[Device Configs<br/>qc_ultra2, qc_ultra2_earbuds, qc_prince, qc35]
    DISC --> CONN[connect&#40;&#41;]
    CFG --> CONN

    style CAT fill:#ff9f43,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style SUP fill:#26de81,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style UNSUP fill:#778ca3,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style DISC fill:#4a9eff,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style CFG fill:#4a9eff,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style CONN fill:#4a9eff,stroke:#333,color:#fff
```

Each catalog entry carries:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `product_id` | USB PID / Bluetooth Modalias ID | `0x4082` |
| `codename` | Bose internal codename | `"wolverine"` |
| `name` | Marketing product name | `"QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)"` |
| `category` | `headphones`, `earbuds`, or `speaker` | `headphones` |
| `config` | Library config key, or None | `"qc_ultra2"` |

**Public API** (identical across all three libraries):

```
lookup_device(0x4082)    → BoseDevice{wolverine, "QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen)", config="qc_ultra2"}
lookup_device(0x4062)    → BoseDevice{edith, "QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen)", config="qc_ultra2_earbuds"}
lookup_device(0x4075)    → BoseDevice{prince, "QuietComfort Headphones", config="qc_prince"}
is_supported(0x4066)     → False (QC Ultra Headphones: recognized, no config yet)
supported_devices()      → [wolfcastle, baywolf, goodyear, duran, prince, wolverine, lando, edith, serena]
known_devices()          → full catalog
usb_ids(0x4082)          → (0x05A7, 0x4082)
modalias(0x4082)         → "bluetooth:v05A7p4082d0000"
```

The USB vendor ID `0x05A7` is shared by all Bose devices. The catalog
is sourced from Bose's `BoseProductId` registry — the registry's
`value` field is what the device reports in the Bluetooth Modalias
string. Note that USB DFU PIDs (as listed by projects like bose-dfu)
are a **different ID space** and should not be conflated with BT
Modalias PIDs.

Discovery uses the catalog to resolve product IDs to config keys. Devices
with `config=None` are recognized (logged, not errored) but fall back to
a default config since they don't have a tested implementation yet.

### Supported Devices

| PID | Codename | Product | Config |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| `0x400C` | wolfcastle | QuietComfort 35 | `qc35` |
| `0x4020` | baywolf | QuietComfort 35 II | `qc35` |
| `0x4024` | goodyear | Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 | `nc700` |
| `0x4062` | edith | QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen) | `qc_ultra2_earbuds` |
| `0x4075` | prince | QuietComfort Headphones | `qc_prince` |
| `0x402F` | lando | QuietComfort Earbuds | `qc_earbuds` |
| `0x4039` | duran | QuietComfort 45 | `qc45` (inferred, untested) |
| `0x4068` | serena | Ultra Open Earbuds | `ultra_open` (partial) |
| `0x4082` | wolverine | QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) | `qc_ultra2` |
| `0x4083` | unconfirmed | QuietComfort Headphones (2nd Gen) | `qc_ultra2` |

### Known Unsupported (Future Targets)

See `catalog.py` / `catalog.rs` / `catalog.h` for the full device
list. Entries with `config=None` are recognized but not yet
implemented.

## Adding a New Device

To add support for a new Bose device:

1. **Add to the catalog** — add its PID, codename, and name with `config=None`
2. **Discover the RFCOMM channel** — `connect()` tries the config's channel, then probes 2, 8, 9 with a firmware GET (`FALLBACK_CHANNELS`). On Linux, a channel that answers EBUSY (the headset is still closing a previous connection) is retried after 0.5, 1 and 2 s before the probe moves on; ECONNREFUSED gets the same retries on the configured channel only. If the configured channel is still busy after its retries, `connect()` fails at once with a "headphones busy" error instead of probing further; a fallback still busy at the end gets the same error instead of "No BMAP channel found". The retry is Linux-only: macOS IOBluetooth errors carry no errno, so they are never retried. Set `RFCOMM_CHANNEL` to whichever answers on your unit
3. **Check if an init packet is needed** — send GET [0.1] and see if subsequent commands work
4. **Probe features** — GET on known function addresses to see what responds
5. **Create a device config** with the discovered addresses and parsers
6. **Register in the device registry** — add to `get_device()` / `DEVICES`
7. **Set config in catalog** — change `None` to the new config key

Device-specific parsing (e.g. different ModeConfig layouts) is handled by
assigning different parser and builder functions in the config. Some devices
may still need a shared connection fallback when a newer direct-control
feature is absent.

---

## Language Implementations

All three implementations follow the architecture above. The differences
are in how each language expresses the patterns.

### Python (`python/pybmap/`)

```

    └── qc35.py          # QC35 config (module-level constants)
```

**Device configs** are Python modules with module-level constants.
Features are dicts mapping names to `{"addr": (fblock, func), "parser": fn, "builder": fn}`.
This makes feature dispatch a simple dict lookup at runtime.

**Error handling** uses a typed exception hierarchy:
```
BmapError
├── BmapConnectionError   — socket/transport failures (.errno when the
│   │                       socket connect failed)
│   ├── BmapBusyError     — channel still EBUSY after the connect backoff
│   └── BmapDesyncError   — no frame in the reply came from the
│                           requested [fblock.func]
├── BmapAuthError         — device returned error code 5
├── BmapDeviceError       — device returned other error codes, or an
│                           invalid/empty reply to GET, SETGET or START
├── BmapInvalidArgError   — caller supplied invalid arguments
├── BmapTimeoutError      — no response within timeout
└── BmapNotFoundError     — no device found during discovery
```

**Transport** uses Python's `socket` module with `AF_BLUETOOTH` on Linux
and IOBluetooth (PyObjC) on macOS. `RfcommTransport` is an alias for the
platform class chosen at import time.

**Testing**: `pytest` with real-capture test data. No transport mock in
parser tests (parsers are pure functions). Connection tests use a
`MockTransport` helper.

### Rust (`rust/src/`)

```
rust/src/
├── lib.rs               # connect() entry point, public re-exports
├── catalog.rs           # Device catalog (PIDs, codenames, USB/Modalias IDs)
├── protocol.rs          # Packet codec, BmapResponse struct
├── transport.rs         # Transport trait + RfcommTransport (libc sockets)
├── connection.rs        # BmapConnection<T: Transport> generic struct
├── discovery.rs         # find_bmap_device() via bluetoothctl
├── device.rs            # DeviceConfig struct, all parsers/builders
├── devices.rs           # qc_ultra2() / qc_ultra2_earbuds() / qc35()
├── error.rs             # BmapError enum, BmapResult type alias
└── main.rs              # CLI binary (bmapctl)
```

**Device configs** are returned by factory functions (`qc_ultra2() -> DeviceConfig`).
Features are `Option<Addr>` fields on the struct — `None` means unsupported.
The compiler enforces that unsupported features can't be called without
handling the `None` case.

**Feature dispatch** is method-based rather than dict-based. Each
`BmapConnection` method knows which config field to read:
```rust
pub fn anr(&self) -> BmapResult<&'static str> {
    let addr = self.addr(self.config.anr)?;  // None → Unsupported error
    let payload = self.get(addr)?;
    Ok(parse_anr(&payload))
}
```

**Transport** is a trait (`Transport`), enabling mock transports in tests:
```rust
pub trait Transport {
    fn send_recv(&self, packet: &[u8]) -> BmapResult<Vec<u8>>;
    fn send_recv_drain(&self, packet: &[u8]) -> BmapResult<Vec<u8>>;
}
```

`BmapConnection<T: Transport>` is generic over the transport, so tests
use `BmapConnection<MockTransport>` with canned responses.

**Error handling** uses `Result<T, BmapError>` with an enum:
```rust
#[non_exhaustive]
pub enum BmapError {
    Connection(String),
    Auth(String),
    Device { message: String, code: u8 },
    Timeout(String),
    NotFound(String),
    Unsupported(String),
    InvalidArg(String),
    Desync(String),   // no reply frame came from the requested [fblock.func]
    Busy(String),     // channel still EBUSY after the connect backoff
}
```

**Mostly header-only**: Only `transport.cpp` and `discovery.cpp` have
compiled implementations (they use system calls). Everything else —
protocol, parsers, device configs, connection — is in headers.

**Device configs** are inline functions returning `DeviceConfig` structs.
Features use `std::optional<Addr>` — same pattern as Rust's `Option<Addr>`.

**Transport** is an abstract class with virtual methods:
```cpp
class Transport {
public:
    virtual std::vector<uint8_t> send_recv(const std::vector<uint8_t>& packet) = 0;
    virtual std::vector<uint8_t> send_recv_drain(const std::vector<uint8_t>& packet) = 0;
    virtual ~Transport() = default;
};
```

Tests use a `MockTransport` subclass.

**Error handling** uses standard exceptions plus typed ones from
`errors.h`, all derived from `std::runtime_error`: `bmap::device_error`
(device ERROR reply, with `code()`, or an invalid/empty reply to GET, SETGET
or START), `bmap::timeout_error` (no reply within the receive timeout),
`bmap::desync_error` (no frame in the reply came from the
requested `[fblock.func]`), `bmap::unsupported_error` (feature missing on
this device), `bmap::connect_error` (socket connect failed, with
`error_number()` = errno) and its subclass `bmap::busy_error` (channel still
EBUSY after the connect backoff). Bad caller input throws `std::invalid_argument`. Auth errors
(code 5) are a `device_error` with `code() == 5`. The `require()` helper
converts `std::nullopt` to an exception for unsupported features:
```cpp
static Addr require(const std::optional<Addr>& opt, const char* name) {
    if (!opt) throw unsupported_error(std::string(name) + " not supported on this device");
    return *opt;
}
```

**Ownership**: `BmapConnection` owns the transport via `std::unique_ptr<Transport>`.
The `connect()` function returns `std::unique_ptr<BmapConnection>`.

## Building & Testing

A top-level `Makefile` orchestrates all three implementations.
Prerequisites: Python 3, Rust/Cargo, CMake, GCC/Clang, `libbluetooth-dev`.

### Quick Start

```bash
make test        # run all test suites (Python + Rust + C++)
make artifacts   # build release binaries + SHA256SUMS
```

### Available Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make test` | Run all tests across all three languages |
| `make python-test` | Python unit tests (auto-creates virtualenv) |
| `make rust-test` | Rust tests via `cargo test` |
| `make cpp-test` | C++ tests via CMake + ctest |
| `make artifacts` | Build release binaries, strip, generate checksums |
| `make release VERSION=vX.Y.Z` | Full release: test → build → `gh release create` |
| `make clean` | Remove all build artifacts, venvs, dist/ |
| `make integration` | Integration tests (requires paired Bluetooth device) |
| `make help` | Show all targets |

### Build Flow

    subgraph test
        PT[python-test] --> T[test]
        RT[rust-test] --> T
        CT[cpp-test] --> T
    end

    subgraph artifacts
        RB[rust-build<br/>cargo build --release] --> A[artifacts]
        CB[cpp-build<br/>cmake Release] --> A
        A --> STRIP[strip binaries]
        STRIP --> SHA[SHA256SUMS]
    end

    T --> REL[release]
    SHA --> REL
    REL --> GH[gh release create]

    style A fill:#4a9eff,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style REL fill:#ff9f43,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style GH fill:#a55eea,stroke:#333,color:#fff
```

### Release Process

```bash
# 1. Ensure all tests pass and artifacts build
make test
make artifacts

# 2. Create a tagged release with binaries
make release VERSION=v0.2.0

# This runs: test → artifacts → gh release create
# Binaries are named: bmapctl-{rust,cpp}-linux-{arch}
# SHA256SUMS is included for verification
```

### Artifact Verification

```bash
# Download and verify
cd dist/
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS

# Install
chmod +x bmapctl-rust-linux-x86_64
sudo cp bmapctl-rust-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/bmapctl
```

### Language-Specific Builds

Each language can be built independently:

```bash
# Python — virtualenv auto-created
make python-setup   # create venv, install deps
make python-test    # run pytest
make python-build   # sdist + wheel in python/dist/

# Rust
make rust-build     # cargo build --release
make rust-test      # cargo test

# C++
make cpp-build      # cmake + make (Debug)
make cpp-test       # build + run bmap_tests
```
